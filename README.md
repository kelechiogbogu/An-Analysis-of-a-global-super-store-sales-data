- This analysis reveals that our top patronoge comes from customers in the US.
- We found ten most ordered goods with staples at the top.
- From 2011 - 2014, 24.5% of our transaction has resulted in losses.
- The major losses came from the following products: Cubify CubeX 3D Printer Double Head Print, Hoover Stove (White), GBC DocuBind P400 Electric Binding System, Apple Smart Phone (Full Size), Motorola Smart Phone, (Cordless), Samsung Smart Phone (Cordless), Cisco Smart Phone (Cordless), Nokia Smart Phone (Full Size), Lexmark MX611dhe Monochrome Laser Printer and GBC Ibimaster 500 Manual ProClick Binding System.
- This analysis also revealved an upward trend in profit generated in each year covered.
- There is a pattern in monthly sales where June experiences a sharp increase in sales, and a decline in July, followed by another increase in August and September, then a very noticeable decrease in October and a significant increase in November and December. In 2012 however, a decrease in sales was recorded in December.


RECOMMENDATIONS
- The store should ensure that products such as Staples are always in stock because its in high demand, this would enhance a positive customer experience.
- The selling price of the products incurring losses should be increased.
- The management should increase staff performance and productivity to keep them motivated and ready for months like June, August, September, November and December.
- A highly strategic international marketing campaign should be launched in countries that record low orders in order to create more awareness about the store in those countries. The management may also extend this campaign to countries where no orders have been recorded.
